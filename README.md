# Assembly
During the brief pause after the last semester at university, before the beginning of the next one, I decided to spend my spare time learning one of the mith languages I've always been looking at with lust, Assembly language.
I bought the book of Kip Irvine "Assembly Language for x86 processors" and studied a good half of the book, before the beginning of the semester. Not enough to have a thorough understanding of the language, but enough to start writing some code.
This repository contains exercises done and code written during my study of Assembly language.
